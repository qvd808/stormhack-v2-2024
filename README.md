## Introduction
This is a project created for StormHacks 2024.

## Inspiration
SmartExpense was inspired by our team member Terry, who struggled to keep track of his expenses and found it tedious to sort through receipts manually. You can visit this [link](https://expo.dev/accounts/sptrodon234/projects/mobile/builds/dd7a1e74-bc8d-4aa6-a1da-92edaec6fd4e) to try it out

## What it does
SmartExpense is here to simplify your financial management! Using React Native and the Expo Framework, our app allows you to easily capture your receipts and automatically tracks your spending. With our advanced OCR technology, SmartExpense extracts key information like expense categories, prices, and items, creating visual graphs to show where your money goes. Plus, our AI-powered financial tips analyze your spending habits and provide personalized advice to help you save more and make smarter financial decisions.

Here are some features we’re proud of:
- ✅ Receipt scanning with advanced OCR
- ✅ Automatic categorization of expenses using AI
- ✅ Visual graphs to track spending habits
- ✅ Personalized financial tips based on your history

## How we built it
We built SmartExpense using React Native for cross-platform compatibility and integrated the Expo Framework for seamless development. The OCR functionality is powered by machine learning models that parse text from images, while our AI algorithms analyze user data to generate actionable insights.

## What we learned
We gained valuable experience in mobile app development, working with OCR technology, and implementing AI-driven features. This project deepened our understanding of user experience design and the importance of financial literacy tools.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was ensuring accurate OCR recognition of various receipt formats. Additionally, time constraints meant we had to prioritize essential features over more complex functionalities that we wanted to implement. Due to financial constraint, we can not make an iOS build.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully developed a fully functional receipt scanning feature
- Implemented AI algorithms to analyze spending patterns and offer financial advice
- Created an intuitive user interface that enhances user experience
